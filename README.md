## Challenges Faced
Building PokerMind was both exciting and challenging. Integrating real-time poker gameplay with blockchain transactions required innovative solutions to ensure smooth user experience without compromising transparency. Optimizing AI strategies while maintaining fairness was another hurdle that pushed us to implement advanced algorithms like CFR. Additionally, ensuring seamless wallet integration for users unfamiliar with blockchain technology posed a significant challenge that we overcame through intuitive design and onboarding flows.
